Issue: Ethernet enterface not found/shown and no IP found/shown.( In short no internet issues)

----------------------Solution-------------------------

STEP 1:
At first checked the version of ubuntu server with : cat /etc/os-relese command

STEP 2:
check network configuration file 
sudo nano/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yml

configure the file for Ethernet with DHCP:

network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp1s0:  
      dhcp4: 

Configuration for Ethernet with static IP
network:          # No indentation
  version: 2      # 2 spaces
  renderer: networkd   # 2 spaces
  ethernets:      # 2 spaces
    enp1s0:       # 4 spaces (2 additional spaces for the nested level)
      addresses:         # 6 spaces (2 more spaces for the nested level)
        - 192.168.1.100/24   # 8 spaces (2 more spaces for the nested level)
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1   # 6 spaces (back to the previous level)
      nameservers:            # 6 spaces (back to the previous level)
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]   # 8 spaces (2 more spaces for the nested level)

      
Save the file and apply the changes with
sudo netplan apply 
      
      
Note: make sure to check the network interface name:
for this use ip a command and verify the name. In my case my case it is enp1s0

STEP 3:
check for the networking services used by your system:

sudo systemctl list-units --type=service |grep network

check for network-manager or systemd-neworkd or NetworkManager service

if you find any of the name listed restart it:

sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd

STEP :4

Enable the systemd-networkd  service
systemctl enable systemd-networkd

STEP 5:

Retart the systemd-networkd service
systemctl restart systemd-networkd 

STEP: 6

Check if the servie is running
sudo systemctl status systemd-networkd

STEP : 7

verify the interface 
ifconfig 
ping google.com
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is how you solve interface not showing after each boot of the system and the interface does't take any ip.
